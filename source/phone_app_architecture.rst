==============================

Source Code

- https://github.com/Itsbrilliantlabs/Monocle_phone_app/tree/production_monocle

This is a React Native app, and the libraries most pertinent to software architecture are the following:

- React Native - 0.68.2 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native/v/0.68.2
- React Navigation - 6.0.10 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-navigation/native/v/6.0.10
- React Native Stack - 6.6.2 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-navigation/native-stack/v/6.6.2
- Redux Toolkit - 1.8.1- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit/v/1.8.1
- React Native SQLite Storage - 6.0.1 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-sqlite-storage/v/6.0.1

Coding convention notes:

- Class components are used as opposed to hooks and functional components.
- Promise Resolve is used as opposed to async await.
- Events are processed using Redux Saga.
